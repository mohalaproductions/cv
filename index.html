        <h1>Vicki Clear</h1>
        <p><em>Provost of <a href="https://www.txinstitute.org/"><strong>Texas Institute of Professional Psychology</strong></a></em></p>
        <p>Born in Colorado, I nonetheless consider myself a Dallas native, one of those folk who “got to Texas as soon as I could.” What may be even more true is that although I was not born at the piano bench, I got <strong>there</strong> as soon
          as I could. I am, at heart, both an artist and a scholar, and have fed my soul a steady diet of music and books since an early age. This thirst for knowledge has brought breadth and depth to my studies, with an undergraduate degree in arts
          and education from
          Texas Tech University, advanced studies in theology, and ultimately, the pursuit of an MBA as a means of being ever more equipped to serve the needs of the Texas Institute of Professional Psychology and its students.
          <br><br>
          My mind loves to dwell at the intersection of beauty and function, the creative and the practical. It is so often how I see God revealed in creation. And it is in this spirit, with this blend of systematic thought and creative vision, that
          I
          approach my role as director of academic affairs at TIPP, providing strategic leadership, guidance, and support for the development of academic programs, evaluating the quality of our current processes and programs with an eye toward growth
          and
          the future, and always ensuring that TIPP is providing for our students in the best way possible.
          <br><br>
          I, too, have had the honor of serving <a href="http://www.richlandoaks.org/">Richland Oaks Counseling Center</a>—in an administrative capacity—and have seen the impact the Center and the many skilled clinicians it employs have made in the
          lives
          of the community. My own personal journey has led me to a deep and profound appreciation of mental health professionals and the services they provide. And at Richland Oaks, I had the privilege of being the support to those who provide
          support—helping the world’s helpers, if you will. From that position, I
          witnessed just how great the need is for accessible mental health care from experienced and well-trained clinicians. In my work at TIPP, I daily bring this history, a heart that longs to alleviate suffering, and the joy that comes with
          being
          partner in an institute responsible for bringing more skilled helpers to a world profoundly troubled.
